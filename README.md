# job-scheduler
It is a job scheduling program which maintains the list of financial services of daily operation processing job developed using data structures and Python.

- A company, XYZ financial services, has a list of daily operation processing jobs which run their business operations.
- Jobs that load prices, transactions, validate incoming transactions, end of day reports etc.
- We required a job scheduling program which maintains the scheduling of these daily jobs. We also need the program to be dynamic, new jobs can be scheduled and scheduled jobs can be removed from the schedule during the day.
- Based on the specs, BST fits these specifications perfectly.
